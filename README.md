In this project i was able to utilize the html elements that i was taught such as the paragraph, header, image, link and list tags. I created index.html on the root directory of odin-recipes, created a recipes directory and added 4 html files that contained a recipe within. I was able to create easy navigation by adding hyperlinks to each recipe in the index file and a home hyperlink on each recipe file. I was also able to create easy readability by adding the recipe hyperlinks into a list in index.html.
